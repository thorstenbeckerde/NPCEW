# NPC Emotion Weaver
## **Beyond the Dialogue Tree**

We've all met them: the shopkeeper with a single line, the guard who repeats the same warning forever, the quest-giver whose only purpose is to be an exclamation point on a map. These NPCs are shellsâ€”functional, but lifeless. They exist to serve a purpose, not to live in a world.

I believe that memorable characters, the ones players talk about for years, are different. They feel coherent. They have an inner logic, a history of hurts and hopes that informs their actions, even when they aren't speaking. Their emotions are not simple on/off switches, but a complex, fuzzy, and resonant inner landscape.

**NPC Emotion Weaver was built on a single conviction: the most compelling characters have a soul, and that soul can be mapped.**

### **Who This Is For**

This tool is for the creators, the world-builders, and the storytellers who believe that character depth is not a luxury, but a necessity for immersive experiences.

* **For the Narrative Designer & Writer:** Go beyond the character sheet. Visualize the intricate web of motivations, traumas, and triggers that define your characters. Ensure their reactions are consistent and meaningful, creating arcs that feel earned.  
* **For the Quest & Systems Designer:** Design gameplay loops that interact directly with an NPC's emotional state. Create triggers that shift the map, leading to new behaviors, dialogue, and emergent narrative opportunities.  
* **For the Art, Animation & Audio Teams:** Use the map as a shared blueprint. An animator can see that a "high-intensity" state of "Resentment" close to the NPC's core should be reflected in their posture. A voice actor can understand the subtext of a "dissonant" feeling of "Doubt" beneath a line of dialogue.  
* **For the Solo Developer & Hobbyist:** Rapidly prototype complex characters and brainstorm entire emotional arcs without getting lost in documents. Use the AI co-pilot to break through creative blocks and discover surprising facets of your characters.

### **What It Is: A Visual Language for the Inner World**

Inspired by the **Fuzzy Emotion Mapping System (FEMS)**, the NPC Emotion Weaver is not just a diagramming tool; it is a narrative instrument. It translates the abstract, "fuzzy" nature of emotion into a tangible, visual language.

* **An Emotional State is a Node:** Each circle on the map is more than a mood. It's a memory, a core belief, a simmering ambition, or a secret fear.  
* **Size is Intensity:** A large node is a powerful, dominant feeling that colors the NPC's every action. A small one is a subtle, background influence.  
* **Distance is Relevance:** States close to the "NPC Core" are active and pressing. States far away are repressed, forgotten, or subconscious drivers.  
* **Color is Emotional Tone:** A fixed palette gives you a consistent, at-a-glance understanding of the underlying feelingâ€”calm, stress, curiosity, or conflict.  
* **Resonance is Feeling:** The waveforms show the *texture* of an emotion. Is it a stable, humming resonance or a sharp, jarring dissonance? This is the difference between quiet confidence and anxious bravado.  
* **Transitions are the Story:** The arrows between states are where the narrative happens. A transition isn't just a state change; it's a story beatâ€”a trigger, a decision, a memory surfaced. This is how your character *evolves*.

There is also **AI integration available via Google Gemini** (needs a free API key). You can ask it to elaborate on a state's inner monologue, suggest a line of revealing dialogue, or generate a holistic profile of the character you've built. Itâ€™s not necessary to use \- itâ€™s there if you like some assistance.

### **My Motivation: For Characters That Breathe**

The goal of NPC Emotion Weaver is to empower creators to build characters that feel less like code and more like people.

1. **To Move Beyond Static Sheets:** Character bibles are essential, but they are static. An emotional map is a *dynamic system*â€”a living blueprint of a character's psychology that can be changed, iterated upon, and stress-tested.  
2. **To Create Emotional Coherence:** Why does a character react with anger to a seemingly innocuous comment? The map can show the link to a distant but powerful "Memory of Betrayal." It provides the "why" behind the "what."  
3. **To Foster True Collaboration:** The map is a single source of truth that a whole team can understand intuitively. It unifies narrative, art, and design, ensuring everyone is building the *same* character.  
4. **To Build Worlds, Not Just Levels:** A world is defined by the characters who inhabit it. By giving NPCs a rich inner life, we create a world that feels deeper, more reactive, and ultimately, more real.

**Go forth and have fun weaving inner worlds.**


### **Core Concepts**

The map is built from a few key visual elements:

* **NPC Core Node:** The central gray circle labeled "NPC" represents the character's core self or current emotional state. All other emotional states radiate from this center.
* **Emotional States (Aspects):** Each colored circle is an "Aspect"â€”a specific emotional influence, memory, motivation, or mood.
* **Transitions:** Arrows drawn between Emotional States represent the flow and triggers that cause an NPC's emotions to shift from one state to another.

#### **Reading the Visual Language of the Map**

Each property of an Emotional State has a specific meaning, allowing you to understand the NPC's inner world at a glance. 

* **Text Label:** The name of the emotion, thought, or influence (e.g., "Resentful," "Hopeful," "Loyalty to the Crown").
* **Size (Intensity):** The size of a circle indicates its emotional intensity. A larger circle feels more present and strong, while a smaller one is more subtle or in the background. 
* **Distance from Core (Relevance):** A state's distance from the central NPC Core shows its relevance. Closer states are more pressing and active, while farther states are more distant, repressed, or less conscious. 
* **Color (Emotional Tone):** Colors represent the fundamental emotional tone of a state, based on a fixed palette for consistency. 
    * **Green:** Grounded, safe, calm, or healing. 
    * **Yellow:** Alertness, curiosity, tension, or new ideas. 
    * **Red:** Stress, conflict, pressure, or overwhelm. 
    * **Gray:** Numbness, confusion, or disconnection. 
    * **Blue:** Calm, reflection, peace, or insight. 
    * **Purple:** Deep or complex feelings like awe, grief, or transformation. 
* **Connection to NPC Core:** The line connecting a state to the NPC Core shows its influence.
    * **Solid Line:** A strong, clear influence. 
    * **Dashed Line:** A subtle, weaker, or uncertain connection. 
* **Aura Symbol (Modifier):** Optional symbols add another layer of meaning to a state. 
    * **ðŸ”’ Blocked:** The emotion is suppressed or inaccessible. 
    * **ðŸŒ€ Spiraling:** The emotion is obsessive or stuck in a loop. 
    * **ðŸ’§ Fading:** The emotion is diminishing or easing. 
    * **ðŸŒ± Emerging:** The emotion is new, developing, or growing. 
    * **ðŸª¨ Fixed:** The emotion is deeply ingrained, stubborn, or feels unchangeable. 
    * **âš¡ Conflicted:** The NPC has internal conflicts about this state.
* **Waveform (Volatility):** A waveform shows the internal "feel" of an emotion. The amplitude (height) of the wave indicates how strongly this is felt. 
    * **Stable (Sine Wave):** Represents emotional resonance; a smooth, stable feeling. 
    * **Volatile (Sawtooth Wave):** Represents emotional dissonance; a sharp, jarring, or unstable feeling.
